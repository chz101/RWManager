# Rimworld Mod Manager
A simple standalone Rimworld mod manager, written in Rust, because I couldn't get RimPy to work :c

# Installation
I don't know how to install this

# TODO

# Hold until GUI
Add path to mod properties? Yeah, need images. 
Add descriptions?

## Parsing

 - Write out inactive and active mods lists
 - load in from saved mods lists (inactive and active)
 - Add new mods to current mod list upon discovery

# Stretch Goals

In order of importance:

 - Make a config file


 - Manifest.xml?
 - Set Game Version?
 - Reload Button
 - Folders/Subdividers
   - Auto Open on hover with item?
 - Coloring
 - Saving Backups
 - Saving Local Mod Copy

# Compatibility

 - Idk if windows works...
